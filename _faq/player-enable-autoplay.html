<section>
    <p>The autoplay features has been added to NewPipe recently. We wanted to keep the UI as clean as possible.
        Therefore you can only enable an disable this feature via the settings:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Open the settings.</li>
        <li>Open the <code>Content</code> category.</li>
        <li>Toggle the <code>Auto-queue next stream</code> option to append a related stream automatically
            when the stream starts. This has no effect on repleating play queues.</li>
    </ol>
